                <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
                <p>IoT Server uses cookies to provide you with the best user experience, and to securely identify you.
                   You can disable cookies if you so wish . However you might not be able to access some of the services
                   if you disable cookies.</p>
                <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
                <p>A browser cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your device to help websites and mobile
                   apps remember things about you. Other technologies, including Web storage and identifiers associated
                   with your device, may be used for similar purposes. In this policy, we use the term “cookies” to
                   discuss all of these technologies.</p>
                <h3>How does Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 process cookies?</h3>
                <p>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 uses cookies to store and retrieve information on your browser. This
                   information is used to provide a better user experience. Some cookies serve the purpose of allowing a
                   user to log in to the system, maintain sessions, and keep track of activities within the login
                   session.</p>
                <p>Some cookies in Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 are used to personally identify you. However, the cookie
                   lifetime ends once your session ends, i.e., after you log-out, or after the session expiry time has
                   elapsed.</p>
                <p>Some cookies are simply used to give you a more personalised web experience, and these cannot be used
                   to identify you or your activities personally.</p>
                <p>This Cookie Policy is part of the IoT Server <a href="{{@app.context}}/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy.</a>
                </p>
                <h3>What does Entgra IoT Server 3.0.0 use cookies for?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are used for two purposes in Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0.</p>

                    <li>To provide a satisfying user experience.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4><u>Preferences</u></h4>

                <h4><u>Security</u></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 uses selected cookies to identify and prevent security risks. For example,
                        Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 may use cookies to store your session information to prevent others from
                        changing your password without your username and password.
                    </li>
                    <li>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 uses session cookie to maintain your active session.</li>
                    <li>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 may use a temporary cookie when performing multi-factor authentication and
                        federated authentication.
                    </li>
                    <li>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 may use permanent cookies to detect the devices you have logged in
                        previously. This is to to calculate the <b>risk level</b> associated with your current login
                        attempt. Using these cookies protects you and your account from possible attacks.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4><u>Performance</u></h4>
                <p>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 may use cookies to allow <b>Remember Me</b> functionalities.</p>
                <h4><u>Analytics</u></h4>
                <p>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 as a product does not use cookies for analytical purposes.</p>
                <h4><u>Third party cookies</u></h4>
                <p>Using Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 may cause third-party cookie to be set in your browser. Entgra IoT Server
                   4.0.0 has no control over how any of them operate. The third-party cookies that maybe set
                   include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Any social login sites. For example, third-party cookies may be set when Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0
                        is configured to use “social” or “federated” login, and you opt to login with your “Social
                        Account”.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any third party federated login.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Entgra strongly advises you to refer the respective cookie policies of such sites carefully as Entgra has
                   no knowledge or use on these cookies.</p>
                <h3>What type of cookies does Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 use?</h3>
                <p>Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 uses persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps Entgra IS
                   4.0.0 to recognize you as an existing user so that it is easier to return to Entgra or interact with
                   Entgra IS 4.0.0 without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser
                   and will be read by Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0 when you return to Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0.</p>
                <p>A session cookie is a cookie that is erased when the user closes the Web browser. The session cookie
                   is stored in temporarily and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not
                   collect information from the user’s computer.</p>
                <h3>How do I control my cookies?</h3>
                <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through settings. However, if you limit the given ability
                   for websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience since it will no longer be
                   personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.
                   Most likely, disabling cookies will make it unable for you to use authentication and authorization
                   functionalities offered by Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the use of cookies, please contact the entity or
                   individuals (or their data protection officer, if applicable) running this Entgra IoT Server 4.0.0
                   instance.</p>
